# Introductory Examples

This folder contains the intro-level examples for Rust on the ESP32-C3.

You probably want to look at [the book](https://github.com/esp-rs/std-training/) for the teaching material to go with them.

## List of examples

Each example has an 'exercise', which is unfinished and for you to complete, and a 'solution' which is fully completed.

### hardware-check [(link)](./hardware-check)

This is just to help check that your hardware is working correctly.

### http-client [(link)](./http-client)

This is a basic HTTP client, capable of fetching web pages over HTTP or HTTPS.

### http-server [(link)](./http-server)

This is a basic HTTP server, which you can access using a web-browser on your PC.

### mqtt [(link)](./mqtt)

This starts an MQTT client, using some configuration to provide the host IP address and port. You will probably want to run an MQTT Server on your PC.
