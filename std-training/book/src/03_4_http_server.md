# A Simple HTTP Server

We're now turning our board into a tiny web server that upon receiving a `GET` request serves data from the internal temperature sensor.

## Setup

You can find a prepared project skeleton in `intro/http-server/`. It includes establishing a Wi-Fi connection, but you must configure it to use your network's credentials in `cfg.toml`.

`intro/http-server/examples/https-server.rs` contains a solution. You can run it with the following command:

```console
cargo run --example http_server
```

## Serving Requests

To connect to your board with your browser, you need to know the board's IP address.


âœ… Run the skeleton code in `intro/http-server`. The output should yield the board's IP address like this:

```console
I (3862) esp_netif_handlers: sta ip: 192.168.178.54, mask: ...
...
Server awaiting connection
```

The `sta ip` is the _"station"_, the Wi-Fi term for an interface connected to an access point. This is the address you'll put in your browser (or other HTTP client like `curl`).

> ðŸ”Ž ESP-IDF tries to register the hostname `espressif` in your local network, so often `http://espressif/` instead of `http://<sta ip>/` will also work.
>
> You can change the hostname by setting `CONFIG_LWIP_LOCAL_HOSTNAME` in `sdkconfig.defaults`, e.g.: `CONFIG_LWIP_LOCAL_HOSTNAME="esp32c3"`

Sending HTTP data to a client involves:
- Creating an instance of `EspHttpServer`
- Looping in the main function, so it doesn't terminate - termination would result in the server going out of scope and subsequently shutting down
- Setting a separate request `handler` function for each requested path you want to serve content. Any unconfigured path will result in a `404` error. These handler functions are realized inline as Rust closures via:

```rust
server.fn_handler(path, Method::Get, |request| {
    // ...
    // construct a response
    let mut response = request.into_ok_response()?;
    // now you can write your desired data
    response.write_all(&some_buf)?;
    // once you're done the handler expects a `Completion` as result,
    // this is achieved via:
    Ok(())
});

```


âœ… Create a `EspHttpServer` instance using a default `esp_idf_svc::http::server::Configuration`. The default configuration will cause it to listen on port 80 automatically.

âœ… Verify that a connection to `http://<sta ip>/` yields a `404` (not found) error stating `This URI does not exist`.

âœ… Write a request handler for requests to the root path (`"/"`). The request handler sends a greeting message at `http://<sta ip>/`, using the provided `index_html()` function to generate the HTML String.

## Dynamic Data

We can also report dynamic information to a client. The skeleton includes a configured `temp_sensor` that measures the board's internal temperature.

âœ… Write a second handler that reports the chip temperature at `http://<sta ip>/temperature`, using the provided `temperature(val: f32)` function to generate the HTML String.
ðŸ’¡ If you want to send a response string, it needs to be converted into a `&[u8]` slice via `a_string.as_bytes()`
ðŸ’¡ The temperature sensor needs exclusive (mutable) access. Passing it as owned value into the handler will not work (since it would get dropped after the first invocation) - you can fix this by making the handler a `move ||` closure, wrapping the sensor in an `Arc<Mutex<_>>`, keeping one `clone()` of this `Arc` in your main function and moving the other into the closure.

## Troubleshooting

- `httpd_txrx: httpd_resp_send_err` can be solved by restarting, or `cargo clean` if nothing happens.
- Make sure your computer and the Rust ESP Board are using the same Wi-Fi network.
