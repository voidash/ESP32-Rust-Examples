# Writing an IÂ²C Driver - Hard Version

We're not going to write an entire driver, merely the first step: the `hello world` of driver writing: reading the device ID of the sensor. This version is labelled hard, because you have to come up with the content of the methods and research information in the [`embedded-hal`](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/latest/embedded_hal/) and datasheets yourself. You can work in the same file with either version.

`i2c-driver/src/icm42670p.rs` is a gap text of a very basic IÂ²C IMU sensor driver. The task is to complete the file, so that running `main.rs` will log the device ID of the driver.

`i2c-driver/src/icm42670p_solution.rs` provides the solution to this exercise. If you want to run it, the imports need to be changed in `main.rs` and `lib.rs`. The imports are already there, you only need to comment the current imports out and uncomment the solutions as marked in the line comments.

## Driver API

### Instance of the Sensor

 âœ… Create a struct that represents the sensor. It has two fields, one that represents the sensor's device address and one that represents the `IÂ²C` bus itself. This is done using traits defined in the `embedded-hal` crate. The struct is public as it needs to be accessible from outside this crate, but its fields are private.

 âœ… Implement an instantiating method in the `impl` block. This method needs to be accessible from outside, so it's labelled `pub`. The method takes ownership of the IÂ²C bus and creates an instance of the struct you defined earlier.


#### Device Address

 âœ… This IÂ²C device has two possible addresses, find them in the [datasheet, section 9.3](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DS-000451-ICM-42670-P-v1.0.pdf).


ðŸ”Ž  We tell the device which one we want it to use by applying either `0V` or `3.3V` to the `AP_AD0` pin on the device. If we apply `0V`, it listens to address `0x68`. If we apply `3.3V` it listens to address `0x69`. You can therefore think of pin `AD_AD0` as being a one-bit input which sets the least-significant bit of the device address.

âœ… Create an enum that represents both address variants. The values of the variants need to be in binary representation.

### Representation of Registers

âœ… Create an enum that represents the sensor's registers. Each variant has the register's address as value. For now, you only need the `WhoAmI` register. Find its address in the datasheet.

âœ… Implement a method that exposes the variant's address as `u8`.

### `read_register()` and `write_register()`

âœ… Check out the `write` and `write_read` function in the `embedded-hal`. Why is it `write_read` and not just `read`?

<Details>
    <Summary>Answer</Summary>
The reason for this lies in the characteristics of the IÂ²C protocol. We first need to write a command over the IÂ²C bus to specify which register we want to read from.
</Details>

âœ… Define a `read_register` and a `write_register` method for the sensor instance. Use methods provided by the `embedded-hal` crate. They serve as helpers for more specific methods and as an abstraction that is adapted to a sensor with 8-bit registers. This means that the data that is written, as well as the data that is read is an unsigned 8-bit integer. Helper methods can remain private as they don't need to be accessible from outside this crate.

âœ… Implement a public method that reads the `WhoAmI` register with the address `0x75`. Make use of the above `read_register()` method.

âœ… Optional: Implement further methods that add features to the driver. Check the [documentation](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DS-000451-ICM-42670-P-v1.0.pdf) for the respective registers and their addresses. ðŸ’¡ Some ideas:
 * Switching the gyroscope sensor or the accelerometer on
 * Starting measurements
 * Reading measurements

### ðŸ”Ž General Info About Peripheral Registers

- Registers are small amounts of storage, immediately accessible by the processor. The registers on the sensor are 8 bits.
- They can be accessed by their address
- You can find [register maps](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DS-000451-ICM-42670-P-v1.0.pdf) in the section 14.
- Returning a value with MSB and LSB (most significant byte and least significant byte) is done by shifting MSB values, and OR LSB values.
```rust
let GYRO_DATA_X: i16 = ((GYRO_DATA_X1 as i16) << 8) | GYRO_DATA_X0 as i16;
```
